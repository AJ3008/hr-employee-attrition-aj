Details about the project. What did you do, How did you do and any other relevant info that would be necessary for evaluator to  judge your work. 

This project was created as part of INSAID capstone project to help HR advisories to detect possible employees who may end up quitting the organization. The data was sourced from the HRMS where the details of all past and current employee were being recorded for the last 8 years. 

In this project the outcome is the classification where we judge if the employee is likely to quit or not.
